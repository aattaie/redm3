Note '------->' mean steps what I have done

2.3. Installing or upgrading on Debian or Ubuntu

We provide an official Phusion Passenger APT repository. This APT repository contains Phusion Passenger packages for multiple versions of Debian and Ubuntu. These packages are automatically built by our build server after we push out a source release, and thus are always up to date with the official source releases.

If you use these packages to install Phusion Passenger then you do not need to run passenger-install-apache2-module or passenger-install-nginx-module. These packages contain all the binaries that you need.

Packages are available for the x86 and x86_64 architectures. Our policy is to support all Ubuntu LTS releases that are still supported by Canonical, plus the latest Ubuntu release, plus all Debian releases that are still supported by Debian.
2.3.1. Adding our APT repository

------->Install our PGP key. Packages are signed by "Phusion Automated Software Signing (auto-software-signing@phusion.nl)", fingerprint 1637 8A33 A6EF 1676 2922 526E 561F 9B9C AC40 B2F7.

------->sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 561F9B9CAC40B2F7

------->Add HTTPS support for APT. Our APT repository is stored on an HTTPS server.

------->sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates

------->Create a file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/passenger.list and insert one of the following lines, depending on your distribution.

-------> Open source

        ##### !!!! Only add ONE of these lines, not all of them !!!! #####
