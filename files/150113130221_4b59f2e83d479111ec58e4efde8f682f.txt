Install Memcache

Installing memcache takes several steps.

To start, install memcached via apt-get.

----->sudo apt-get install memcached

The next step is to install php-pear, the repository that stores memcache.

------>sudo apt-get install php-pear

If you do not have a compiler on your server, you can download build-essential in order to install memcache:

------>sudo apt-get install build-essential

Finally use PECL (PHP Extension Community Library) to install memcache:

------>sudo pecl install memcache

Say yes by pressing enter during the installation when you are asked if you would like to “Enable memcache session handler support? [yes] :”

Once you have completed the installation of memcache with PECL on the VPS, add memcached to memcache.ini:

------>echo "extension=memcache.so" | sudo tee /etc/php5/conf.d/memcache.ini

Now you are ready to start using Memcache.
Confirm Memcache and See Stats

After Memcache is downloaded, you can check that it has been installed by searching for it:

ps aux | grep memcache

Additionally, you can see the memcache stats by typing:

------>echo "stats settings" | nc localhost 11211
